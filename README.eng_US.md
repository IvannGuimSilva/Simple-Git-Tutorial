# Git Commands Tutorial
**`note:`** `I've probably made some command tests for self educational purposes here.`

This article has the aim of enhance, teach and remove doubts in my mind. And to help me with some version control concepts.

## Concepts Introduction:

I have used very nice guides in English which teach the whole methodology about GIT, they came from a tutorial on the dev.to website, [here](https://dev.to/gothamv/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-475c).

## First Steps and Command List:

#### 0. Download GIT (if it isn't already on your computer)

You will need this program, because it's just the program that you need to manage version controlling on your PC. In the case that you're a Windows user, go on this [link](https://git-scm.com/download/win) for **instant download**.

Alter that, verify on your command prompt; typing **git --version** to see if GIT is already installed. In the affirmative case, it will show on the screen the number of the git version, otherwise windows will just tell you that there isn't any program of this nature installed.

#### 1. Create a repository on Github

Create an empty repository on Github for in the future use it to bind and synchronize a repository inside your PC to it. And with that mechanism, manage the version controlling of your code linked to Github.

#### 2. Turn a repository of your computer in a GIT repository

#### `WARNING:`
#### `The main content starts here.`

Go to the folder you wish to turn in a local GIT repository on your PC. Through the use of cmd (command prompt), go to it by typing its path and go to inside it just by typing the command **cd folder's_name**, then just type **git init** inside that folder.
